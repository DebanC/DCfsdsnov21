    "1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "Ans-RGBA(Red-Green-Blue-Alpha). The RGB color model is extended in this specification to include “alpha” to allow specification of the opacity of a color.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?\n",
    "Ans-Pillow offers the ImageColor.getcolor() function so you don’t have to memorize RGBA values for the colors you want to use. This function takes a color name string as its first argument, and the string 'RGBA' as its second argument, and it returns an RGBA tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n",
    "Ans-The box.tuple submodule provides read-only access for the tuple userdata type. It allows, for a single tuple: selective retrieval of the field contents, retrieval of information about size, iteration over all the fields, and conversion to a Lua table."

Where background color is not constant, and hence depends upon the context for which the image is to be used."
