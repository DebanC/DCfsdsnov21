    "Ans-csv.writer class provides two methods for writing to CSV. They are writerow() and writerows().\n",
    "\n",
    "writerow(): This method writes a single row at a time. Field row can be written using this method.\n",

    "Ans- The delimiter is the character that appears between cells on a row. By default, the delimiter for a CSV file is a comma. The line terminator is the character that comes at the end of a row. By default, the line terminator is a newline. You can change characters to different values by using the delimiter and lineterminator keyword arguments with csv.writer().\n",
